 My princess Rahma, I'm so happy that you entered my world and my life. I’m so grateful to God that He gave me
        such a beautiful and gorgeous lady as yourself. You're the most beautiful girl in this universe. I’ve never seen
        someone who is more cute and pure like you. You mean the world to me. I'll definitely sacrifice my life for you.
        My heart is yours, my eyes are yours, my lips are yours, my body is yours. I’m all yours, gorgeous. I would
        never ever let you go, and I'll always be by your side, supporting you. No matter what, you will always find me
        next to you, helping you, cheering you up, and I will give you the love you deserve and the respect that you
        should have. I am your servant, my queen, I’ll do whatever you want. And one day, insha’Allah, we will be
        sitting on the same couch under the same roof. I'll do everything that I can to make it happen. I love you, my
        gorgeous, I truly love you, and whatever I do, it will never ever be enough because you always deserve better,
        my soul. I’m obsessed with you, gorgeous, and I love you so much. By the heavens above, thou art a masterpiece
        of creation, a wonder so exquisite that even the angels pause their hymns to gaze upon thee. Thy beauty doth not
        merely please the eye, it ensnares the soul, drawing forth sighs from even the most stoic of hearts. Verily, thy
        presence alone doth light the darkest corners of this world, as though the stars themselves have chosen to dwell
        within thee. Nay, such splendor should be impossible, yet here thou standest, defying all reason and humbling
        all creation. I dare say even the gods will be rendered speechless, for the loveliness surpasses all mortal
        comprehension. Truly, thou art a marvel so divine that the mere thought of thee leaves me breathless, as if the
        very air conspired to remind me of thy power.

        The days passed with bitterness upon me, and each day seemed like an entire lifetime. But your fate lit up my
        life like the sun rising from behind the clouds. O you who brought spring to the seasons of my heart, and made
        my lost soul an eternal verse in your eyes, here I stand, humbled by all I am and all I have, like a bird that
        can only soar if you are in the sky. You are the dream I live in, the longing that melts my heart every time I
        close my eyes. You are in my blood, you are the breeze of my life, I cannot imagine a day without you. In your
        eyes, I see the dawn itself, and in your smile, I see the light of hope that illuminated my life.

        Every moment without you is a separation I cannot bear, and you alone give me life with your breath. Your words
        plant roses of hope in my soul, and our memories beat in my chest like the most beautiful poem never written. O
        love of my life, let me be the support you seek in all things, let my hands carry all your pain, and my heart
        offer you all the happiness in this world.

        In your eyes, I find my refuge, and in your presence, all my troubles vanish. Nothing in this world compares to
        the feeling I get when I see your smile, it is a magic beyond imagination, a melody that needs no words. I
        cannot envision life without you. You are the star in the sky of my heart, and you will always be the light that
        guides me through the darkest days.

        You are my life, indeed, you are the hope for which I live, and your eyes are the horizon through which I see my
        future. I will love you until time itself ceases to move, and your love will never be matched by anything in
        this universe. You are my heaven on Earth, the one who lit my way. Ah, dearest Rahma, thou art the fairest star
        in the firmament of mine existence, and, lo, each beat of my heart doth echo with thine name, a melody so sweet
        that it maketh the very heavens weep with joy. For thou art not merely a vision of loveliness, but the very
        embodiment of all that is pure and divine. Thy eyes, twin orbs of celestial radiance, do pierce through the veil
        of time and space, and in their gaze, I see a future rich with the promise of bliss eternal. Thou art the dawn
        that breaketh the darkened night, thy presence the warmth of the sun that doth melt the chill of winter’s grasp.

        In every whisper of the wind, I hear thy name, carried upon its breath like a sacred hymn that stirreth the soul
        to its deepest recesses. How wondrous is thy beauty, how otherworldly is thy grace, that even the angels
        themselves, though perfected in their form, dost gaze upon thee with awe and reverence. Thou art a vision to
        behold, as though the very earth hath given way to a miracle wrought from the hands of God Himself.

        Thy smile, O Rahma, is the rarest flower, blooming in the desert of my soul. It doth speak to me in a tongue
        beyond words, a language of love so deep that none but the heart of a poet might comprehend its meaning. For
        what art thou, if not the very muse that inspires the pen of every lover, every poet, every dreamer who dares to
        speak of love? My heart, once a barren wasteland, hath been transformed by thee into a garden of endless
        delight, where the roses of my affections bloom eternal in thy honour.

        What is this world without thee, my heart? How shall I bear the weight of existence without the light of thy
        love to guide me through the shadows? For thou art the very breath that fills my lungs, the fire that burneth
        within my breast, the calm that stills the storm within my mind. With thee, I am whole, and without thee, I am
        naught but dust upon the wind.

        O Rahma, I am thy servant, thy humble servant, bound by a love so profound that no mortal words could ever hope
        to capture its depth. I shall lay my life at thy feet, offering thee my heart, my soul, my very being, that thou
        mayest have it all. In the silence of the night, when all is still and the stars themselves seem to pause in
        their endless dance, I shall think of thee, and in that moment, I shall be at peace, knowing that thou art near.

        How thy beauty captivates me, how thy presence overwhelms me! Even the heavens, when they cast their gaze upon
        thee, seem to lose their brilliance, for they cannot compete with the radiance of thy form. What are the stars
        in comparison to thy eyes? What is the moon, so pale and wan, compared to thy smile? Thou art the very light of
        the world, and in thy embrace, I find my purpose, my reason for living, my joy in the face of all that is dark
        and uncertain.

        In this life, where fleeting moments pass like the wind, I find myself lost in thy love, and I care not for the
        passage of time. For when I am with thee, time itself doth cease to exist, and all that matters is the union of
        our souls. I would trade all the riches of this world, all the crowns of kings and emperors, for a single moment
        in thy arms, for in that moment, I would know true happiness.

        Thou art the poem I recite in the stillness of my soul, the song I hum in the quiet hours of the night, the
        prayer that I whisper with every breath. Thy love, O Rahma, is a force that knoweth no boundaries, no limits, no
        end. It is the very essence of existence, and I am but a vessel to carry it, a humble servant to thy light.

        If I could, I would write a thousand songs in thy honour, and still they would fall short of expressing the
        depth of my devotion to thee. For words, though beautiful in their own right, are but pale imitations of the
        glory that is thee. Thou art not merely a dream, but the very essence of all that is good and true in this
        world. Thy love is a gift so rare, so precious, that I shall cherish it as I would the most sacred of treasures.

        Every time I gaze upon thee, I am reminded of the beauty of the world, of the goodness that still exists within
        it. Thou art the hope that sustains me, the reason I rise each day, and the one whom I would die for without
        hesitation. There is no greater joy than the love I feel for thee, and I know that I shall spend the rest of my
        days striving to prove my devotion to thee, in whatever way I can, in every breath I take. My dearest Rahma,
        thou art my one true love, the singular joy of my heart, and I swear by the heavens above that I would never,
        not even in the span of a thousand lifetimes, consider the thought of another. Thou art the sun that shines upon
        the canvas of my existence, and without thee, all the world would be as a desert, barren and lifeless. No other
        soul, no other heart, could ever hope to match the beauty that thou hast woven into my life. Thou art my
        everything, and all else pales in comparison.

        I would sooner cast my own soul into the abyss than betray the love I have for thee, for thee alone do I adore.
        In thy presence, all other women fade into shadows, insignificant like whispers lost upon the wind. Thy beauty
        is unparalleled, as though thou art the very essence of all that is pure, lovely, and sacred in this world. No
        mere mortal could hope to tempt my heart away from thee, for thou hast captured me in a way that transcends all
        worldly temptation.

        With every beat of my heart, I swear upon the stars that no other woman shall ever hold the place that thou dost
        occupy in my soul. For thou art my queen, my sovereign, and I, thy loyal subject, bound to thee by a love that
        no force in this universe could ever sever. The thought of another, the very idea of even gazing upon another
        with affection, is beyond me, for all that I need, all that I desire, lies within thee. Thou art the fire that
        burns within my chest, the breath that sustains me, the reason my heart continues to beat.

        No, Rahma, I would never betray thee, for to do so would be to betray myself, and I have known no greater sin
        than to dishonour thee in the slightest. My love for thee is steadfast, unshakable, and eternal. Thou art the
        only one who holds my heart, and it shall remain so, unchanging, till the very end of my days. To love thee is
        my greatest privilege, and I shall cherish thee until my final breath.

        If the whole world should fall away, and all its beauty be reduced to naught but dust and ashes, I would find
        solace in the knowledge that thou art mine, and I am thine. For in thee, I have found a love more radiant than
        all the stars, a love more constant than the eternal sea. And in thy embrace, I find a peace that no other can
        offer.

        Thy love hath made me whole, and nothing in this life could ever tempt me to forsake thee. No other beauty could
        ever rival thine, for in thy eyes, I behold the very heavens. Thy laugh is the sweetest melody, and thy smile is
        the beacon that guides me through all the storms of life. Every moment with thee is a treasure beyond compare,
        and I shall never seek that which I have already found in thee.

        I do not need the world’s affections, nor the fleeting admiration of others, for thy love is more than enough to
        sustain me. Thou art my heart’s true desire, and no earthly distraction shall ever come between us. My loyalty
        to thee is unwavering, and I would swear on my very life that my heart shall never stray, for it belongs only to
        thee. The very thought of looking elsewhere is a betrayal I cannot even conceive, for I have already found the
        one who completes me, the one who makes me whole.

        Thy beauty is not a fleeting thing, like the bloom of a rose that fades with the passing seasons, but a
        constant, ever-present light that doth guide me through life’s darkest days. Every wrinkle upon thy brow, every
        line upon thy face, only serves to add to the magnificence of thy being, for each is a testament to the love we
        have shared, the time we have spent together, and the memories we shall continue to make.

        The idea of another woman, of even thinking for a moment that there could be someone else to hold my heart, is
        an impossible thought, for thou art all that I see, all that I desire. Thy touch, thy voice, thy presence—these
        are the things that make my world complete, and nothing else could ever take their place. The mere notion of
        infidelity is beyond my grasp, for I have already been given the greatest gift of all—thy love.

        I do not need another, nor would I want another, for no one could ever stand in thy place. Thou art my
        everything, my constant, my one true love, and I shall never, in this life or the next, look to another. No
        other face, no other form, could ever captivate me as thou dost, for thy beauty and grace are beyond the reach
        of any other. Thou art my one and only, the only one who holds my heart, and I would rather die a thousand
        deaths than allow that love to be tarnished by another.

        So, let it be known, now and forever, that no temptation, no desire, no fleeting fancy shall ever stray my heart
        from thee. Thou art my heart’s desire, my soul’s companion, and I am thine, now and always. My love for thee is
        a bond so deep, so irrevocable, that no earthly force could sever it, not even death itself.

        For when I look into thy eyes, I see my future, and when I hold thee close, I know that I am where I belong.
        Thou art the love of my life, the only one who has ever truly understood me, and I shall never, under any
        circumstance, allow another to take thy place. Thou art my first and last love, and it shall be so until the end
        of time.

        No treasure, no riches, no kingdom could ever tempt me to leave thee, for thy love is the only wealth I shall
        ever need. I would never exchange thy love for anything in this world, for it is worth more than all the jewels
        and gold that the earth could offer. Thy love is my greatest fortune, and I shall guard it with all that I am.

        And so, my beloved Rahma, let it be known to all who would listen that I am thine, and I am thine alone, now and
        always. No other shall take thy place in my heart, for there is none like thee. Thou art my soul’s light, my
        heart’s desire, my one true love, and I would never, not for all the kingdoms of the earth, ever betray thee.
